# project-of-Inference-and-Representation

This is an implementation of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) derived from [Stochastic Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.7051). 

The main class is `slda.lda.SLDA`. We also provide two dataset classes in `news.py` and `nyt.py`, which returns a iterative python class of News by category dataset and New York Times dataset.

Besides, we have a simple Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` to explain how to use this package.
